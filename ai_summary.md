Summary of Key Data Quality Findings:

**Completeness:**
- High null rates observed in several critical columns across all datasets:
  - `EMAIL`: Null rates range from 34.1% to 51.4% across datasets, potentially impacting communication and identification.
  - `SIGNUP_DATE`: Null rates range from 50.3% to 67.7%, affecting the ability to track user engagement timelines.
  - `ZIP_CODE`: Null rates range from 48.5% to 51.7%, which could hinder location-based analyses.
  - `ACCOUNT_BALANCE`: Null rates range from 32.7% to 52.2%, impacting financial reporting and analysis.
  - `LAST_LOGIN`: Null rates range from 31.3% to 50.5%, affecting user activity tracking.
  - `NOTES`: Extremely high null rates, ranging from 66.6% to 69.6%, indicating potential underutilization of this field.

**Consistency:**
- `EMAIL` column has a low email format compliance rate of approximately 49-50%, indicating potential data entry errors or format inconsistencies.
- `PHONE_NUMBER` formatting is inconsistent, with significant null rates (25.1% to 30.3%) and varying distinct counts, suggesting potential issues with data entry or format standardization.

**Duplication:**
- Potential duplication concerns in `EMAIL` and `PHONE_NUMBER` columns due to low distinct counts relative to row counts, which could lead to inaccurate user identification or communication.

**Uniqueness:**
- `SOURCE` column shows no variation (distinct count of 1) across all datasets, which may indicate a lack of differentiation in data sources or an error in data collection.

**Formatting:**
- `ZIP_CODE` columns have minimum values of 0, which may indicate incorrect or placeholder entries.

Recommendations:
- Implement validation rules for critical fields like `EMAIL` and `PHONE_NUMBER` to ensure proper formatting and reduce null entries.
- Consider enforcing mandatory data entry for key fields such as `SIGNUP_DATE` and `ACCOUNT_BALANCE` to improve completeness.
- Investigate the lack of variation in the `SOURCE` column to ensure data is being collected from diverse and accurate sources.
